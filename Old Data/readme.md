# Railway System

A railway system has different routes, stations, and trains. Trains go on different routes, where each route is a sequence of stations. Each train has a specific capacity, and customers can reserve a ticket on a train based on the route and availability. It is assumed that each train reaches its destination on the same day and that every train runs every day.
